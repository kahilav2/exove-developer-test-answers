## 2B. Create an SQL query -- Tomi's Answer

```sql
SELECT 
  name, 
  IFNULL(numbers, 'N/A') AS numbers 
FROM 
  (
    SELECT 
      id, 
      CONCAT (first_name, " ", last_name) AS name 
    FROM 
      people
  ) AS A 
  LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT 
      user_id AS id, 
      GROUP_CONCAT(number) AS numbers 
    FROM 
      phones 
    GROUP BY 
      user_id
  ) AS B ON A.id = B.id;
```

That prints out the folowing:

```sql
+---------------------+----------------------------------+
| name                | numbers                          |
+---------------------+----------------------------------+
| John Smith          | +1 604 444 4444,+44 20 8759 9036 |
| Mary Jones          | +1 213 621 0002,+1 800 444 4444  |
| Gerhard Feuerhaufen | N/A                              |
| Rami Pitkniemi      | +358 50 333 3333                 |
| Anna Krkstrm        | +46 771 793 336                  |
+---------------------+----------------------------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

I concluded from the instructions that the order of results doesn't matter, and that people without phone numbers should be outputted as a string "N/A" rather than a NULL value.
