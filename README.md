## Kahilakoski Tomi-Mikael's answers to the Exove developer test

## Overview
I was assigned this test on Friday with deadline on Sunday, so I didn't have an opportunity to ask for advice.

I have answered exercises 1C, 2B, 3D.

You can find the answers inside this project, from the following paths:
- `1C/`
- `2B.md`
- `3D/` 

### 1C
I chose exercise 1C because I have a strong interest in using React. 

I have a background in Vue.js, so working with React was somewhat painless. That said, I opted for a simple solution without any fancy extras. I hope my solution works as requested and follows best practices. I learned a lot about React. 

### 2B
I chose exercise 2B because it seemed challenging yet I felt confident that I could work it out.

In my last workplace, I did't use relational databases at all. Therefore, I had to try to recall what I had learned in the workplace before that. I knew that I'd need to come up with a fast solution that only uses JOINs, but unfortunately, this time I only could find a solution that uses sub-queries, which are slow. Perhaps with a bit more time I could manage to improve my solution.

I found the answer by just trying out JOINs and other commands until I got partial solutions. From partial solutions, I assembled the final query. I also referenced my old MySQL notes that I wrote during my time at AI Samurai.

### 3D
I chose exercise 3D because I started to run out of time and it seemed like a safe option.

Now that I'm writing this report, I realize that I may have misinterpreted the picture and the instructions, or there may have not been enough instructions to begin with. My solution keeps the content width fixed, but what I now believe the instructions want me to do is have the content, article section included, extend to the full width of the window responsively. Well, I'm not sure.
